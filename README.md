# terraform-reference

### Commands
Initialize terraform repository:
```bash
terraform init 
```
Show what tf files will do:
```bash
terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_vpc.myvpc will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
      + arn                              = (known after apply)
      + assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = false
      + cidr_block                       = "10.0.0.0/16"
      + default_network_acl_id           = (known after apply)
      + default_route_table_id           = (known after apply)
      + default_security_group_id        = (known after apply)
      + dhcp_options_id                  = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink               = (known after apply)
      + enable_classiclink_dns_support   = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_hostnames             = (known after apply)
      + enable_dns_support               = true
      + id                               = (known after apply)
      + instance_tenancy                 = "default"
      + ipv6_association_id              = (known after apply)
      + ipv6_cidr_block                  = (known after apply)
      + main_route_table_id              = (known after apply)
      + owner_id                         = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly
these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```
Apply plan with:
```bash
terraform apply
```
It asks for confirmation - in build scripts we have to auto apply.

In order to destroy:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

### State
Cloudformation maintains a state of your stack on AWS. Terraform uses state file to maintain the state.

### Drift
If two people execute terraform apply at the same time this can lead to drift. 
State drift can make terraform break. In order to fix the drift - we import the AWS configuration to the state.

### Linting
```bash

➜  first-resource git:(main) tflint
Failed to load configurations; main.tf:12,18-25: Invalid type specification; The keyword "stringy" is not a valid type specification.:

Error: Invalid type specification

  on main.tf line 12, in variable "mylist":
  12:   type    = list(stringy)

```
